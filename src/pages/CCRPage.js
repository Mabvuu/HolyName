        <p className="text-gray-800">
          Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement (CCR) was launched at Holy Name with the
          commissioning of the first 73 members of the group in 2009 following Life in the Spirit
          Seminars led by a team from St Canisius, Marlborough. The team included Mr & Mrs Rutunhu,
          Mrs Rateiwa and the late Mrs Wood, to name a few.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mt-2">
          The CCR Holy Name Prayer Group is in its seventh year of existence despite various challenges
          it has faced. It is thanks to the remaining members who have braved, are braving and will
          continue to brave the storms guided by none other than the Holy Trinity.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800">
          The Group has commissioned over 150 members from 2009 to 2017. However, active members
          by way of participation and payment of subscriptions average 25. The Prayer Group remains
          grateful to the LORD for the very active 25 who continue to steer the CCR movement ship to
          greater heights.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#005A9C] mb-4">Meetings</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800">
          The prayer group meets weekly on Monday from 5.30pm. The grotto has become integral to
          our prayer meetings with every prayer meeting starting with Rosary at the Grotto followed by
          the day’s proceedings in the hall.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mt-2">
          In addition to the normal weekly prayer sessions, the Parish Service Team saw it befitting to
          dedicate a special day when they meet as the leadership of the prayer group, before the
          Blessed Sacrament in church in order to draw strength and guidance from “muridzi we
          munda watiri kusakura,” HOLY TRINITY.

        <p className="text-gray-800">
          The prayer group continues to be actively involved in visiting the sick in both Dzivarasekwa
          and Holy Name communities and in Hospitals, as we put into practice evangelization theory.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Comforting the Bereaved</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-800">
          Members of our prayer group participate fully in this key work of mercy by comforting the
          bereaved during and after the funeral. Tiri kuchema nevanochema and it is our hope to
          continue, with the help of the Holy Spirit.
