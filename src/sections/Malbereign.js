            Established in 1985, Mabelreign Central Section (“MC”) began its journey as a prayer group under the leadership of Mrs. Gilbertha Rimbi, sister to the then parish priest, Fr. Gilbert Mordecai. For a year, all meetings, focused on the Rosary, were hosted at Mrs. Rimbi’s home. The founding members included remarkable women like Mrs. Marimba (Vice Chair), Mrs. Gwanzura (Treasurer), and others whose contributions laid the foundation for this vibrant section.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Initially, meetings were separate for men and women, but by the early 1990s, the section evolved into a combined family unit. Activities like praying the Rosary, singing, and practicing Shona hymns helped foster unity and spiritual growth within the group.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Over the years, membership has grown to 30 families, with 22 actively participating. The section introduced cherished traditions, such as Christmas “Get Together” parties, where Mr. Richard Makwiramiti played the beloved role of ‘Father Christmas.’ These gatherings strengthened the bond among members and created lasting memories.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Activities and Challenges</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Mabelreign Central Section actively participates in parish events, including works of mercy, choir competitions, and Bible quizzes. Although the section has faced challenges in singing competitions, primarily due to its elderly membership, it continues to be a pillar of the community, fostering faith and fellowship.

          <p className="mb-4">
            In 1987, the section introduced member subscriptions, which helped sustain its activities and support church initiatives. The section remains a testament to dedication, tradition, and the enduring spirit of its founding members.
