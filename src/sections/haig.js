          <p className="mb-4 text-center">
            Haig Park Section, one of the smallest in the parish, remains vibrant and active in parish activities. Initially a Small Christian Community, it was combined with Meyrick Park Section but later split in the 1990s due to growth. Despite a decrease in numbers, the section currently has 18 active families.
